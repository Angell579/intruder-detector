## Basic Details
### Team Name: POWER KIDS


### Team Members
- Team Lead: ANGEL TERESA - SNMIMT ENGINEERING COLLEGE, ERNAKULAM
- Member 2: JERALD JAXON - SNMIMT ENGINEERING COLLEGE, ERNAKULAM
- Member 3: IRIN JEROME - SNMIMT ENGINEERING COLLEGE, ERNAKULAM

### Project Description
This project is an Intruder Detection System that uses a combination of ultrasonic sensor and Arduino uno to detect intruders and alert the user.

### The Problem 
burglary, vandalism, and other security threats.

### The Solution 
it used to protect against burglary, vandalism, and other security threats.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- c program
- Arduino IDE

For Hardware:
- Arduino uno
- Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator (CSTCE16M0V53-R0), a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button.
- alarm,Sensors,leds

An intruder detector using motion sensors is a security device that identifies movement within a designated area. These sensors typically use infrared technology to detect heat emitted by people or animals. When motion is detected, the system can trigger alarms, send notifications to your smartphone, or activate surveillance cameras.

Motion sensors can be used indoors and outdoors and are often adjustable to minimize false alarms caused by pets or small objects. They are a key component of many modern security systems, providing an effective way to enhance home or business security.
