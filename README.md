### Project Description
This project is an Intruder Detection System that uses a combination of ultrasonic sensor and Arduino uno to detect intruders and alert the user.

### The Problem 
burglary, vandalism, and other security threats.

### The Solution 
it used to protect against burglary, vandalism, and other security threats.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- c program
- Arduino IDE

For Hardware:
- Arduino uno
- Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator (CSTCE16M0V53-R0), a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button.
